         <span>Progenitor virus </span> is a family of RNA
         viruses. Progenitor is immensely ancient, and is suspected of being hundreds of
         millions if not billions of years old, and is considered to have both aided and
         hindered evolution of Earth's ecology through the extremities of its resulting
         mutations.</p>

         <span>Tyrant Virus</span>, otherwise known as the t-Virus, is the general name given to
         a series of mutant Progenitor virus
         strains. Initially developed by Umbrella Pharmaceuticals in the late 1960s, the primary goal
         of the "t-Virus Project" was to effectively eliminate the need for a large-scale conventional
         army and generate revenue to go to their eugenics program, the Wesker Project. This required two
         things: the virus had to be highly-contagious to the point of infecting an entire target
         population and guarantee a 100% mortality rate. Such a virus was impossible due to such
         contagions' tendencies to kill too many people at once and prevent further spread.</p>

       Ashford which, under the correct conditions, allows the host to retain full
       intellectual capabilities. It is named after Veronica Ashford, the Ashford family's

      The Golgotha Virus, abbreviated as <span>G-Virus</span>, is a retrovirus in
      the Progenitor family of viruses. Golgotha was developed by Umbrella USA as
      a bioweapon to rival and surpass Tyrant Virus ("t-Virus"). The two viruses,
      while being descended from Progenitor, are totally dissimilar. Whereas t-Virus
      typically causes relatively minor mutations in human hosts, like Zombies and
      Tyrants, Golgotha causes such extreme genetic mutations that victims are no longer
       recognizable as human</p>

    <p>
     <span>Uroboros (ウロボロス?)</span> is an RNA virus in the Progenitor family.
     Engineered in the 21st century by Dr. Albert Wesker as the ultimate eugenics
     tool, a less potent strain was later developed by Dr. Alex Wesker to serve as a
     bio-weapon. There is currently no known vaccine for either strain of Uroboros.
     The virus' name is derived from the Ouroboros in Greek mythology, a snake or
     snake-like creature which consumed itself.</p>

   identified during the 2011 Marhawa Desire incident, and went on to appear during
   the 2013 attacks in Tall Oaks and Tatchi. Following the demise of Neo Umbrella,
   Umbrella Co. continued to study some Zombies which were discovered in the ruins of
   the Antarctic Base.</p>
